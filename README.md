# Title

## Introduction
```
This document details the generation of a java program that uses method 
calls and for loops. This code is managed inside github
where we use the markdown format to present our report.

```

## Outline
```java
//Create the addition game to call methods
//print out method calls
```

Example how to do a void method call
public static void printgrade (double score) {
then you would add a return or you could do if and else statements

## Summary
```
The purpose of this assignment was to take what we have learned from method calls and for loops 
and apply it to something we have already done, which is the addition game. 
This time we make it easier to write out the code because instead of copiying and pasting
all four rounds we just assign some code to a method call or for loop, or both, 
and make the quiz faster and less tedious.
